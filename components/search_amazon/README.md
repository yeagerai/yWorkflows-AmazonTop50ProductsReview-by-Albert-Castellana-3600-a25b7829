# Component Name

SearchAmazon

# Description

The SearchAmazon component is a building block in a Yeager Workflow that enables users to search for products on Amazon. Its primary function is to search for products based on their names and return a list of product URLs. This component uses an external API to perform the searched and processes the response accordingly.

# Input and Output Models

The component has two data models:

1. **SearchAmazonInputDict:** Represents the input data for the SearchAmazon component.

    - `product_name`: (str) The name of the product to search for.
    - `limit`: (Optional[int]) Maximum number of product URLs to return.

2. **SearchAmazonOutputDict:** Represents the output data from the SearchAmazon component.

    - `product_urls`: (List[str]) A list of product URLs found based on the input search query.

Both models are Pydantic BaseModel instances, which help in data validation and serialization.

# Parameters

The component uses the following parameters:

1. **result_limit**: (int) The default maximum number of product URLs to return if the input does not specify a limit. It is read from the component's YAML configuration file.

# Transform Function

The `transform()` method takes an instance of `SearchAmazonInputDict` and returns an instance of `SearchAmazonOutputDict`. The method follows these steps:

1. Check if a limit is provided in the input data, otherwise use the default `result_limit` value.

2. Call the `search_amazon_api()` method, passing the product name and the limit. This method makes an API call to the external Amazon search service.

3. Collect the product URLs returned by the API call.

4. Instantiate and return a `SearchAmazonOutputDict` object containing the list of product URLs.

# External Dependencies

The component relies on the following external dependencies:

- `os`: Used to help load the component's YAML configuration file.
- `openai`: May be used for AI-related tasks within the component.
- `typing`: Imported for type annotations (`List`, `Optional`).
- `fastapi`: Utilized to create the FastAPI app and the POST endpoint.
- `pydantic`: Used for creating input and output data models and validation.
- `requests`: Needed for making API calls to the external Amazon search service.
- `yaml`: Required to parse the component's YAML configuration file.

# API Calls

The component makes an API call to the external Amazon search service via the `search_amazon_api()` method. The function sends a GET request with the following parameters:

- `q`: The product name to search for.
- `limit`: The maximum number of product URLs to return.

The API returns a JSON response containing a list of product URLs.

# Error Handling

The component does not currently implement specific error handling for API calls or other exceptions. If an error is encountered, it will raise a general exception and return an error message accordingly.

# Examples

To use the SearchAmazon component in a Yeager Workflow, you can do the following:

1. Define the input data for the component:
