# Component Name

AmazonReviewScraper

# Description

The *AmazonReviewScraper* is a Yeager component designed to fetch and retrieve product reviews from Amazon using a list of product URLs. The component accepts product URLs as input, scrapes the reviews using an external API, and returns a collection of reviews for each product.

# Input and Output Models

This component uses **Pydantic** for input and output models validation and serialization.

## Input Model

The *ProductURLsInputDict* model consist of:

- `product_urls`: A list of strings representing product URLs. 

## Output Model

The *ReviewsOutputDict* model includes:

- `reviews`: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary consists of string keys representing product URLs and a list of strings as value, containing the reviews associated with the product URL.

# Parameters

The *AmazonReviewScraper* class does not have any adjustable parameters apart from the input data.

# Transform Function

The `transform()` method processes the input data as follows:

1. Initialize an empty dictionary called `output`.
2. Iterate through the product URLs in the `args.product_urls` list:
   a. Use the `external_api_client.scrape_amazon_reviews(url)` function to fetch the reviews for the current URL.
   b. Add an entry to the `output` dictionary where the key is the current URL and the value is the list of scraped reviews.
3. Return the `output` dictionary wrapped as a *ReviewsOutputDict* object.

# External Dependencies

This component uses the following external libraries:

- `pydantic`: Utilized for creating input and output models, as well as data validation and serialization.
- `fastapi`: A web framework used to set up the API endpoint for the transform function.
- `external_api_client`: A placeholder for the actual API client library that is responsible for making API calls to scrape the Amazon reviews (replace with the actual library as needed).

# API Calls

This component makes use of the following external API call:

- `external_api_client.scrape_amazon_reviews(url)`: Fetches product reviews for the given Amazon product URL.

# Error Handling

Any errors encountered during the transformation process will be raised by the API client library or the Pydantic validation. Make sure to catch and handle specific exceptions and error messages as necessary in your Yeager Workflow.
